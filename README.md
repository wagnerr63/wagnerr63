I'm Wagner Ribas, software engineer from Brazil. My first contact with coding was in 2018, when I was coursing IT at SENAI institution, where I built a solid base of programming logic, OOP and databases. I learned desktop development with Java and web development with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. At the end of the course we had to build a real project for a client.
